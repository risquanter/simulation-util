      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (which shall not include modifications made by third parties
      other than the Licensor).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based upon (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and derivative works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright
      owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on
      behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition,
      "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written
      communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives,
      including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing
      lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that
      are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of
      discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that
      is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the
      copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, prepare
      Derivative Works of, and display, perform, sublicense, and sell the
      Work and such Derivative Works in all media and formats, whether now
      known or later developed, provided, however, that You may distribute
      the Work only under the terms of this License.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          Object form of the Derivative Works; in the documentation or
          other materials provided with the Derivative Works.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless you explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by you to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions
      accompanying such submission. These additional terms and conditions
      may be included in a separate agreement or may be included in the
      notice file accompanying the Work.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for describing the origin of the Work and
      reproducing the content of the NOTICE file, if any.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" basis,
      without warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or
      implied, including, but not limited to, any warranties or conditions
      of title, non-infringement, merchantability, or fitness for a
      particular purpose. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has
      been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting the License. You accept and agree to be bound by the
      terms and conditions of this License by exercising any rights
      granted to you under this License. If you do not agree to these
      terms and conditions, you must not use or distribute the Work.

  10. Miscellaneous.

      (a) This License represents the complete agreement concerning
          the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License
          is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed
          only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.

      (b) If you modify and redistribute the Work, you should provide
          notice of such modification and redistribution in a manner
          specified by the Licensor.

      (c) The rights granted under this License may not be assigned or
          transferred without the prior written permission of the
          Licensor, except that you may assign or transfer your rights
          under this License in connection with a merger, acquisition,
          or sale of all or substantially all of your assets, provided
          that the assignee or transferee agrees to be bound by the
          terms and conditions of this License.

      (d) This License shall be governed by and construed in
          accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction specified by
          the Licensor, without regard to its conflict of law
          provisions. If no jurisdiction is specified, the laws of
          the State of California, USA, shall apply.

      (e) The Licensor may publish revised and/or new versions of
          this License from time to time. Such new versions will be
          similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
          detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is
          given a distinguishing version number. If the Work specifies
          that a certain numbered version of this License "or any later
          version" applies to it, you have the option of following the
          terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of
          any later version published by the Licensor. If the Work does
          not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
          any version ever published by the Licensor.

      (f) If any provision of this License is found to be invalid or
          unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such
          provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible,
          and the remaining provisions of this License shall remain in
          full force and effect.

      (g) Any waiver of any provision of this License will be effective
          only if in writing and signed by the party against whom
          enforcement is sought.

      (h) The headings in this License are for convenience only and
          shall not affect the interpretation or construction of this
          License.

      (i) This License may be executed in counterparts, each of which
          shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall
          constitute one and the same instrument.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published
    by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU Affero General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
get its source code.  For example, if your program is a web application,
its interface could display a "Source" link that leads to an archive
of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source code, and
different solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13
for the specific requirements.

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
