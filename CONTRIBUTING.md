# Contributing to Java Metalog Distribution

This project uses two mechanisms to manage contributions:

## Licensing and Contributions

### Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO v1.1)
All contributions must be signed-off, certifying the Linux Foundation's Developer Certificate of Origin version 1.1
(https://developercertificate.org/). This certifies you have the right to submit the work under the project's AGPL license.

### Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
In addition to the DCO, contributors must sign our CLA which explicitly:
- Grants rights for both AGPL and commercial licensing
- Extends beyond the DCO's open source scope
- Allows for commercial relicensing

Both mechanisms are required because:
- DCO covers contributions under the AGPL
- CLA covers additional commercial licensing rights

## How to Contribute

### 1. Sign the CLA
Before your first contribution, you must sign our CLA which:
- Grants rights for both AGPL and commercial licensing
- Waives claims on commercial licensing revenue
- Allows us to relicense your contributions

To sign the CLA:
1. Open your first Pull Request
2. The CLA Assistant bot will automatically comment on your PR
3. Click the link provided by the bot to review the CLA
4. Sign in with your GitHub account
5. Click "Sign" to accept the agreement

The CLA Assistant will:
- Record your signature digitally
- Link it to your GitHub account
- Track your acceptance across PRs

### 2. Use DCO for All Commits
For every commit:
```bash
git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
```
This adds the DCO sign-off to your commit.

### 3. Submit Your Contribution
1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch
3. Make your changes
4. Commit with DCO sign-off
5. Submit a Pull Request

## Verification

Your PR will be checked for:
1. CLA signature (one-time)
2. DCO sign-off (every commit)
3. Code quality
4. Tests
5. Security implications
